# Desgin Patterns Examples in Unity

This is my project for practicing design patterns in Unity. I started this project since reading [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/). The sample code in the book is written in C++, of which some features cannot be found in C#(for example : union, friend...etc).

Please notice that these implementations are meant for demonstration, not production code.

I also wrote a article on HackMD about these things, you can find it [here](https://hackmd.io/_XCk-FyzRgqpJ5cK9qOukQ).
